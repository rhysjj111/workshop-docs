-   :material-format-list-group: &nbsp; __[Built-in group plugin][group]__

    ---

    The group plugin allows to group plugins into logical units to conditionally
    enable or disable them for specific environments with the use of
    [environment variables][mkdocs.env].

    ---

    __Optimal management of plugins when building in different environments__

-   :material-file-tree: &nbsp; __[Built-in meta plugin][meta]__

    ---

    The meta plugin makes it easy to manage metadata (front matter) for all
    pages in a folder, so a certain subset of pages uses specific tags or a
    custom template.

    ---

    __Simpler organization, categorization and management of metadata__

-   :material-folder-open: &nbsp; __[Built-in projects plugin][projects]__

    ---

    The projects plugin allows to split your main project into multiple distinct
    projects, build them concurrently and preview them together as one.

    ---

    __Connect multiple projects together, and build them separately or as one__

-   :material-information: &nbsp; __[Built-in info plugin][info]__

    ---

    The info plugin is a small and useful utility that helps to create
    self-contained minimal reproductions, so we maintainers can fix reported
    bugs more quickly.

    ---

    __Your bug reports are of the highest quality, so we can fix them as fast as
    possible__
