=== "Add untracked product (placeholder)"
    You might need to add an "untracked product" (a placeholder) in situations where you don't have a purchase invoice. Here are some common use cases:

    * **Quoting:** Adding a temporary product entry while preparing a quote, before the actual purchase.
    * **Existing Stock:** Registering items already in stock that weren't acquired through a formal purchase invoice.

        1. Scroll down to "Products" section.
        2. Click "Create Product"
        3. Select "Untracked Product" in top right hand corner.
        4. Enter a **product number**.
            * **Recommendation:** Prefix your product numbers with "JJ" (e.g., `JJ OIL FILTER` or `JJ WISHBONE`).
        5. Select the supplier as "J & J Commercials LTD".
        6. Fill in cost price, description and sale price fields.
        7. Create the product.

    !!! note
        * Even for untracked products, there must be a product number. You can make up any product number.
        * It is best to prefix the number with "JJ" ie. JJ "OIL FILTER" or "JJ WISHBONE", so that they can be easily found and reused.
