# Customers and Suppliers

This section will cover information related to customers, including setting up a customer.

## Customer Fields

### Customer Details

`Customer Name/Business Name`
:   + Either customer or business name must be filled in. 
    + If a name is used, the title must be selected (Mr/Mrs etc.), as this will be used in automated emails.

`Address`
:   Use the search button to search for a customers address from the postcode (costs one credit, Â£0.10), or enter the details manually.

`Accounting Code`
:   Leave blank - This is used as a reference for accounting software (Sage). However we use the automatically generated 'Customer Number' which can be found in the top left of the customer details screen once a customer has been created.

`Account Customer`
: Select if this is an account customer for J & J commercials Ltd. Defined by whether the customer has terms.

`Priority Message`
:   Give a short warning message about the customer which will be visable at all times. Can be used to state things such as 'Customer must pay before taking vehicle."

`Payment Terms`
:   Can be used as a reminder of a customers payment terms, but it does not change the functionality of the customer. ie. "30" for 30 days.

`Require Customer Reference For Invoice`
: Tick this if the customer requires a Purchase Order number with an invoice. (ie. Shield Environmental and Shield Fire and Security)

**All other boxes**: Leave as standard.

### Customer Information
`Email`
: + Enter the customers email address.
+ To add multiple email addresses, seperate them with ;
    + ie. joe@gmail.com;sue@gmail.com
!!! note "Reminders (MOT/booking reminders) will be sent to all emails stored in this field."
    + If accounts requests not to receive these reminders, either:
        + Reminders must be turned off
        + The accounts email should be stored in the customer notes and added to invoice emails.
