### MOTs

Cardiff Bay Auto Centre LTD (Parfitts) will send an invoice every month.
When the invoice is received:
- **Check the MOTs have been charged out**: Perform and MOT labour report and cross reference the invoices charged out with the list of vehicles on the invoice.
- **Deal with discrepencies**: Charge out any MOTs that are missing or query unrecognised MOTs with Parfitts.
- **Add invoice as a purchase order**: Add all MOTs as a single product, 'mots' and adjust price. Complete purchase order with invoice details.
